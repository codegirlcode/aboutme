						<p>Meet me, h, a Front-End Web Developer with a rush for Ruby. I began my journey into coding a year ago, and haven't looked back since. Learning how to program has been a challenge but a fruitful one. Programming builds character. As a #womenintech I have found the effortless desire to show, and give hope to newcomers. While I am still new to field, I can confidently say that I am here to stay, and improve my skillset. Follow my path as i code my way through the crowd to Software Developer | Rubyist.</p>

					<p><p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px;">General Assembly</span> has been a great experience to me. I studied Fron-End Web Development - cohort #FEWD5, and graduated in Oct'15. Prior to GA, I had no coding experience. I can say that I have learned a lot as a person, and now have earned the ability "to think like a computer" as my teacher would say. While a student, I gained skills in HTML/CSS | JavaScript/jQuery. We shortly dived into Bootstap|APIs. While I am still new to field, learning has not fallen short from my daily routine.- <a href="www.generalassemb.ly">www.generalassemb.ly</a></p> 

					<p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px;">Girl Develop It</span> Girl Develop It Atlanta has been a great push into to my journey into Back-End Development. I attended the Intro to Ruby class Feb, and loved it. There we were taught the core knowledge of Ruby. From Strings, Arrays, Variables, Objects, Loops, Files, Methods, and Classes. GDI was a friendly environment, and gave me the confidence to continue into Ruby. <a href="www.girldevelopit.com">www.girldevelopit.com</a></p>

					<p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px;">One Month</span> One Month is an online tech training. I have enrolled in One Month Rails, and have built my first Rails app - a Pinterest-like site. With One Month Rails, I have learned Rails deployment, Heroku Migration..

					<p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px;">Learn</span> Learn is the online portal of Flatiron School. I have enrolled into the Ruby course. With the help of Learn, I have build a Tic Tac Toe game using Ruby. Not short of a solid Object Oriented Programming understanding. -<a href="www.learn.co">www.learn.co</a></p>
